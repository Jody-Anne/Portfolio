        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"></p>Books and More is a website that provides a range of functions with CSS and
            HTML as well as Bootstrap. This project shows of all the things one can 
            with just CSS and Bootstrap in the beginning of Web development.
        </p>
        <p>My role as the web developer was to design the website and to ensure that
            it was functional and suitable for the needs of a client. I planned the design before 
            the coding took place to match the needs of the task that was given to us.

        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"></p>Crazy Car deals was a website that tested our
        JavaScript skills, the basic HTML and CSS is there but the car displays was made possible by
        JavaScript and the onclick function that allows you to view more details on the cars.
        </p>
        <p>My role as the web developer in this task was to get the cars to show without the use
            of CSS and Bootstrap, as that would have been a more length route to take. JavaScript 
            allows us to do more by writing less code.

        <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"></p>Crazy Potters is a fully functional website that shows off
        the skills of JQuery, CSS and HTML. The task that was given to us was to ensure that it was a website
        that users can use to place delivers and show the total amout with tax and different deliver fees.
        </p>
        <p> The role as a web developer in this task was to design, code and test that everything worked, I had
        to ensure that everything ran smoothly as well as make it appealing to customers to use.
